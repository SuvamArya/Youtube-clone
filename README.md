# Youtube-clone

A modern youtube clone application in React Js using Material UI 5. I have used Youtube v3 API from RAPID API to fetch the data. You have to use your own key and put it in the .env file to use it. 

The app has all features including searching, video player, channel viewer, suggested videos, and is completely Responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.
